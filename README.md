## Leveraging aggregations, subqueries, and aliasing in PostgreSQL to investigate international debt. 

Exploring international debt figures using a simple, clean dataset. Debt indicators provide unique points of analysis to find commonalities between countries' debts which share similar geographic and political circumstances. While context for the data is lacking from the project dataset, the focus of this project is to execute quaeries and aggregations using PostgreSQL.
